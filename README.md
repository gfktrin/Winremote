# Winremote
A remote control program for Windows.

You can control your computer from any device who has internet connection and a browser.Besides that you can control more than one computer at once.
## Usage
Put a webpage of your preference (I recomend blogger because it's simple to change the title as you can see here: https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kBtzlCr-jBU/V56-RCw7QjI/AAAAAAAAAok/ITddgVdp7TwhSvgOklGjynidgblGqkrXQCCo/s912/title.PNG) in the get.title() function. Note that every computer has to have a different id, the defaul is '1', but you can change that by command or editing the id file, when it's written 'id' in the commands you will know that is to write the id you defined.
Then you execute the program. After that you can change your webpage's title for the following commands:
* idshutdown

  Turns off the computer.

  Shows a message with notepad.

  Changes the computer's id.
